# haikugen
Python script that generates original haikus following the 5/7/5 syllable pattern. Most of them will be complete nonsense.

## Usage
You can either run haiku.py directly from the command line, or you can use the flask [deployment](https://haiku--gen.herokuapp.com/)

## Contributing
You can contribute by adding words to words.json.<br>
Please make sure they are under the correct syllable category. Words must be between 1-7 syllables. Run the contents of your modified version of words.json through https://jsonlint.com/ to avoid typos.
